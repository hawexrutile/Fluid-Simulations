The formation of groups and the coordinated movement seen in swarms or flocks are characteristic features of living systems, spanning from bacteria and sperm to schools of fish, bird flocks, and animal herds. This collective behavior typically arises without central control, instead being influenced by how individuals respond to the actions of other group members or agents. The resulting patterns and structures are not solely determined by physical interactions but often involve nonreciprocal information input. For example, in the case of birds and animals, visual perception plays a crucial role, involving the processing of information and active responses. Understanding these underlying mechanisms not only illuminates the behavior of biological systems but also offers insights for designing synthetic active systems. These systems can adapt to environmental conditions and autonomously perform intricate tasks.
